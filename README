The class CodeToolkit.java contains the functional implementations for part 3 of the assignment.
Functional Sizes of EI and EO and EQ have been considered as 10, 7 and 4 respectively.

The Graph class has been modified in the following ways:
* getNodeCount() and getEdgeCount() has been added to return the count of edges and nodes.
* two counter variables to count the increment the nodes and edges whenever the counter gets incremented.

Part 1 of the assignment has been added as a docx file in the root of this project.

KINDLY MODIFY THE DIRECTORY STRING TO THE "INPUT" folder in the project if necessary.
The INPUT folder contains both the class files and java files and the code is expected to filter out
the respective file types.
